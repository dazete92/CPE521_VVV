      <div class="desc" id="definition_text"> A cookie is a piece of data sent from a website that is stored in the browser.</div>
    </div><br>
    <div class="cinfo" id="use_case"> What are cookies used for?
      <div class="desc" id="use_text"> Cookies are used to remember browser state information, such as browsing activity and passwords. Each time a website is loaded, the browser sends the cookie back to the website to remind it of previous activity. One popular example that uses cookies is an online shopping cart, where items remain in the cart when the online store is revisited. Another popular example is login preservation, which allows a user to visit their email page without having to log in every time.</div>

    <div class="cinfo" id="security"> Security Implications of Cookies
      <div class="desc" id="security_text"> If cookies aren't secured properly or stolen, they can be used by an attacker to steal information or impersonate users. If a valid user is using cookies to authenticate access to their email and an attacker steals their cookies, the attacker can then access the user's email without needing to provide login information.</div>
