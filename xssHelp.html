    <div class="xinfo" id="definition"> What is XSS?
      <div class="desc" id="definition_text"> Cross site scripting (XSS) is a type of code injection, in which malicious code (usually javascript) is inserted into an otherwise safe, trusted web site. When this code gets loaded into the browser of another user, it is executed. For example, a malicious user may enter <i>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;xss&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;</i> into the comment field of a forum which saves it as a comment on the server. When another user visits the forum and loads the web page their browser, believing the code to be from the trusted website, will execute the script.</div>

    <div class="xinfo" id="security"> Security Implications of XSS
      <div class="desc" id="security_text">XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve disclosure of the user&quot;s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack the user&quot;s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirect the user to some other page or site, or modify presentation of content.</div>

    <div class="cinfo" id="best_practice"> Best Practices
      <div class="desc" id="best_list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li><b>Validate Input</b> - All input received from users should be treated as <i>untrusted data</i> and should be checked by the server. If a name is expected, confirm there are only alphabetic characters in the input. If a price is expected, confirm there are only numbers in the input. Remember, all input validation needs to be implemented server side as client side validation can be bipassed.</li>
          <li><b>Sanitize Input</b> - </li>
          <li><b>Encode Output</b> - All untrusted user data being displayed in a web page needs to be encoded on the way out. This means that special characters, such as &lt;&gt;/;&amp;=, will be encoded with <i>html encoding</i> and they will be displayed as text, not interpretted as code. It is also important to understand the context that the untrusted data is being output to so that it gets encoded properly. For example, if untrusted data is included in a URL it needs to be encoded with <i>URI encoding</i> instead of html encoding because there is a different set of special characters for URL's, than html.</li>
