    <div class="xinfo" id="definition"> What is XSS? (click)
      <div class="desc" id="definition_text"> Cross site scripting (XSS) is a type of code injection, in which malicious code (usually javascript) is inserted into an otherwise safe, trusted web site. When this code gets loaded into the browser of another user, it is executed. For example, a malicious user may enter <i>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;xss&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;</i> into the comment field of a forum which saves it as a comment on the server. When another user visits the forum and loads the web page their browser, believing the code to be from the trusted website, will execute the script.</div>

      <div class="desc" id="security_text">XSS can cause a variety of problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve disclosure of the user&quot;s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack the user&quot;s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse programs, redirect the user to some other page or site, or modify presentation of content.</div>
